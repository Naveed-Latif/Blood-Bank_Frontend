# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses console errors and warnings in the blood donation application. The application currently experiences various console errors that affect user experience and debugging capabilities. These errors need to be systematically identified and resolved to ensure a clean, error-free console output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a clean console without errors, so that I can effectively debug and maintain the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the console SHALL NOT display any React-related errors
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the console SHALL NOT display routing errors
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the console SHALL NOT display unnecessary error logs for expected failures
4. WHEN components render THEN the console SHALL NOT display key prop warnings
5. WHEN hooks are used THEN the console SHALL NOT display hook dependency warnings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the blood type to display correctly, so that I can see my actual blood type instead of "Unknown".

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a blood type in their profile THEN the dashboard SHALL display the correct blood type
2. WHEN user data is fetched from the API THEN the blood type field SHALL be properly mapped
3. WHEN the blood type is missing THEN the system SHALL display "Not specified" instead of "Unknown"
4. WHEN the API returns blood_type field THEN the frontend SHALL correctly map it to bloodType

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want page navigation to work correctly, so that when I click on navigation links the page content actually changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a navigation link THEN the page content SHALL update to show the correct page
2. WHEN the URL changes THEN the corresponding component SHALL render
3. WHEN navigating between protected routes THEN the authentication check SHALL not interfere with routing
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the correct component SHALL render based on the current URL
5. WHEN using browser back/forward buttons THEN the correct page SHALL display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can identify and fix issues without cluttering the console.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN errors SHALL be logged with appropriate context
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully without excessive logging
3. WHEN development mode is active THEN detailed error information SHALL be available
4. WHEN production mode is active THEN error logging SHALL be minimal and user-friendly
5. WHEN errors are caught THEN they SHALL include relevant debugging information
