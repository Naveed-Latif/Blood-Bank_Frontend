# Design Document

## Overview

The refresh token functionality needs to be fixed to handle token expiration gracefully and provide a seamless user experience. The current implementation has several issues:

1. The AuthContext doesn't handle token refresh during initial app load
2. The API client's refresh logic has race conditions and doesn't properly handle queued requests
3. Error handling and user feedback during refresh failures needs improvement
4. The refresh token mechanism doesn't integrate properly with the AuthContext state management

## Architecture

The solution involves three main components working together:

1. **Enhanced API Client**: Improved token refresh logic with proper request queuing and error handling
2. **Updated AuthContext**: Integration with token refresh and proper state management during refresh operations
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better user feedback and graceful degradation when refresh fails

## Components and Interfaces

### ApiClient Enhancements

The `ApiClient` class will be enhanced with:

- **Improved Request Queue Management**: Better handling of concurrent requests during token refresh
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: More robust error detection and recovery
- **State Synchronization**: Better integration with AuthContext for user state updates
- **Retry Logic**: Improved retry mechanism for failed requests after token refresh

Key methods to enhance:
- `request()`: Better 401 handling and queue management
- `refreshToken()`: Enhanced error handling and state updates
- `processQueue()`: Improved queue processing with better error propagation

### AuthContext Integration

The `AuthContext` will be updated to:

- **Handle Initial Token Validation**: Check and refresh tokens on app startup
- **Integrate with API Refresh**: Listen for refresh events and update user state accordingly
- **Provide Refresh Status**: Expose refresh state to components for better UX
- **Handle Refresh Failures**: Properly clean up state when refresh fails

New methods and state:
- `refreshing` state: Track when token refresh is in progress
- `validateAndRefreshToken()`: Method to validate current token and refresh if needed
- Enhanced `checkAuthStatus()`: Better initial authentication check with refresh capability

### Error Handling Strategy

Implement a comprehensive error handling strategy:

- **Network Errors**: Distinguish between network issues and authentication failures
- **Token Errors**: Handle different types of token-related errors appropriately
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear feedback during refresh operations
- **Fallback Behavior**: Graceful degradation when refresh is not possible

## Data Models

### Token Refresh State

```javascript
{
  isRefreshing: boolean,
  failedQueue: Array<{resolve: Function, reject: Function}>,
  refreshAttempts: number,
  lastRefreshTime: timestamp
}
```

### Auth State Enhancement

```javascript
{
  user: User | null,
  loading: boolean,
  refreshing: boolean,  // New field
  error: string | null  // New field
}
```

## Error Handling

### Token Refresh Errors

1. **Network Errors**: Retry with exponential backoff
2. **Invalid Refresh Token**: Clear auth state and redirect to login
3. **Server Errors**: Log error and attempt retry with limits
4. **Concurrent Refresh**: Queue requests and process after completion

### User Experience During Errors

1. **Loading States**: Show appropriate loading indicators during refresh
2. **Error Messages**: Display user-friendly error messages
3. **Automatic Retry**: Attempt automatic recovery where appropriate
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Redirect to login when recovery is not possible

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. **API Client Tests**:
   - Test token refresh logic with various scenarios
   - Test request queuing during refresh
   - Test error handling for different failure modes
   - Test concurrent request handling

2. **AuthContext Tests**:
   - Test initial token validation
   - Test state updates during refresh
   - Test error handling and cleanup
   - Test integration with API client

### Integration Tests

1. **End-to-End Authentication Flow**:
   - Test complete login -> token expiry -> refresh -> continued usage flow
   - Test multiple concurrent requests during token expiry
   - Test refresh failure and logout flow
   - Test app startup with expired tokens

### Error Scenario Tests

1. **Network Failure Tests**:
   - Test behavior when refresh endpoint is unreachable
   - Test behavior with intermittent network issues
   - Test timeout handling

2. **Token Failure Tests**:
   - Test behavior with invalid refresh tokens
   - Test behavior with expired refresh tokens
   - Test behavior with malformed tokens

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Fix API Client Token Refresh
- Enhance the `refreshToken()` method with better error handling
- Improve the request queuing mechanism
- Add proper state management for refresh operations
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Phase 2: Integrate with AuthContext
- Add refresh state management to AuthContext
- Implement initial token validation on app startup
- Add proper error handling and user state cleanup
- Integrate refresh events with user state updates

### Phase 3: Enhance User Experience
- Add loading states during refresh operations
- Implement proper error messaging
- Add graceful fallback behavior
- Improve debugging and logging

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Implement integration tests
- Test error scenarios
- Validate user experience improvements
