# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance API Client token refresh mechanism



  - Fix the refreshToken() method to handle errors properly and return consistent results
  - Improve the processQueue() method to handle both success and error cases correctly
  - Add proper state management for refresh operations with attempt counting and timing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Fix request queuing and retry logic in API Client





  - Improve the request() method's 401 handling to properly queue and retry requests
  - Fix race conditions in the refresh mechanism when multiple requests fail simultaneously
  - Add proper error propagation from queued requests back to original callers
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Add token validation and refresh capability to AuthContext



  - Create a validateAndRefreshToken() method that checks token validity and refreshes if needed
  - Add refreshing state to track when token refresh operations are in progress
  - Integrate token refresh events with user state management
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Enhance AuthContext initialization with token refresh




  - Update checkAuthStatus() method to attempt token refresh when initial validation fails
  - Add proper error handling for refresh failures during app startup
  - Implement graceful fallback when refresh is not possible
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Improve error handling and user feedback






  - Add comprehensive error logging for token refresh operations
  - Implement proper cleanup of authentication state when refresh fails
  - Add user-friendly error states and loading indicators
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Add integration between API Client and AuthContext





  - Create a mechanism for API Client to notify AuthContext of refresh failures
  - Implement proper user state cleanup when refresh tokens expire
  - Add coordination between API Client refresh state and AuthContext user state
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Test and validate the refresh token functionality





  - Create test scenarios for token expiration and refresh
  - Test concurrent request handling during token refresh
  - Validate error handling for various failure modes
  - Test the complete authentication flow from login through token refresh
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
