# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current refresh token implementation in the blood bank application is not working properly. Users are experiencing authentication issues where the refresh token mechanism fails to automatically renew expired access tokens, leading to unexpected logouts and authentication errors. This feature aims to fix the refresh token functionality to provide seamless user authentication experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to be automatically renewed when my access token expires, so that I don't get unexpectedly logged out while using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an access token expires during an API request THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh the token using the stored refresh token
2. WHEN the token refresh is successful THEN the system SHALL retry the original failed request with the new access token
3. WHEN the token refresh is successful THEN the system SHALL update the stored access token in localStorage
4. WHEN multiple API requests fail simultaneously due to expired tokens THEN the system SHALL queue these requests and retry them all after a single successful token refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be automatically logged out when my refresh token expires, so that my account remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL remove all stored authentication data
2. WHEN the refresh token fails THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page
3. WHEN the refresh token fails THEN the system SHALL clear the user state in the AuthContext
4. WHEN logout occurs due to refresh failure THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle authentication state properly during token refresh, so that the UI remains responsive and shows appropriate loading states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a token refresh is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate refresh attempts
2. WHEN a token refresh is in progress THEN the system SHALL queue subsequent API requests that require authentication
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL attempt to validate the existing token and refresh if necessary
4. IF the initial token validation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt a refresh before logging the user out

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for token refresh operations, so that I can debug authentication issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token refresh operations occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information
2. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error details
3. WHEN token refresh succeeds THEN the system SHALL log success confirmation
4. WHEN network errors occur during refresh THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide fallback behavior
